'''In Python, hash tables are implemented through the built-in dictionary data type. A hash table, also known as a hash map, is a data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations based on key-value pairs. It is essentially a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and mapped to a corresponding value. Here's how hash tables (dictionaries) work in Python:

1. Key-Value Pairs: In a hash table, each element consists of a key and a value. The key is used to uniquely identify the element, and the value is associated with that key. Keys are typically immutable data types, such as strings, numbers, or tuples.

2. Hashing: The key is passed through a hash function, which generates a hash value. A hash function converts the key into a numeric representation, which is used to index into an array (also known as a hash table or hash map). The hash value determines the position (index) in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

3. Array or Buckets: Behind the scenes, Python uses an array of fixed size to store the key-value pairs. Each position in the array is called a bucket. If two different keys have the same hash value (known as a hash collision), they are stored in the same bucket, using additional data structures like linked lists or binary trees.

4. Lookup and Insertion: When you want to retrieve the value associated with a given key, the hash function is used to compute the hash value of the key, which points to the corresponding bucket in the array. The value can then be fetched from that bucket.

   Similarly, when you want to insert a new key-value pair, the hash function is used to compute the hash value, and the pair is inserted into the appropriate bucket.

5. Complexity: Hash tables provide fast average-case time complexity for lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, typically O(1). However, in the worst case, when many collisions occur, the time complexity can increase to O(n), where n is the number of elements in the hash table.

Here's an example of using a hash table (dictionary) in Python:'''

# Create a dictionary (hash table)
student_grades = {'Alice': 85, 'Bob': 72, 'Charlie': 90}

# Retrieve value by key
print(student_grades['Alice'])  # Output: 85

# Insert a new key-value pair
student_grades['David'] = 78

# Update a value
student_grades['Bob'] = 80

# Delete a key-value pair
del student_grades['Charlie']

# Iterate over the keys and values
for name, grade in student_grades.items():
    print(name, grade)
'''
In the above example, the dictionary `student_grades` serves as a hash table, where the names of students are the keys, and their grades are the values. The dictionary allows efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations based on the keys.

Hash tables (dictionaries) are widely used in Python due to their versatility and efficiency in handling large amounts of data. They provide a convenient way to organize and retrieve information based on unique identifiers (keys).'''
